                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Brian is the name I respond to -I mean, that's the name I've had since I was born, why wouldn't I?-, Cisneros being my family name. I have a middle name and a second surename but that would make this text unnecessarily long -aah the irony-. Anyways, I was born in a little town in Argentina called Guatraché, in the province of La Pampa, but I grew up 50km from there in Bernasconi (another teeny tiny town).  </p>
                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Fast forward 28 years and I'm currently living in the portuary city of Bahía Blanca, in Buenos Aires province, separated (it sucks I know) and with a 4 years old beautiful girl. Struggling to find and keep regular jobs but studiyng web developing in hopes to find a better future for myself and my daughter.</p>

                <div class="text2">
                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">In all these years living in this city I've done many things. I've studied Financial Administration, worked as a taxi driver, even cleaned pidgeon's poop from a nuclear reactor as a job. Also, since the first day I moved to the city I began trainging in a Kickboxing dojo (and even fought a handful of fights).</p>
                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">Nowadays I find myself studiyng Web developing at Coderhouse, somenthing I never thought I would, but I can say that I really love it. I just finished the basic Frontend course, being this very website my final project, and I'm currently taking the JavaScript course of the career.</p>

                <div class="text3">
                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">I like videogames (seriously, I love them. I would like to develop games someday), the bands that I listen to the most at the moment are My Chemical Romance (has been my favorite band since I was 13), Foo Fighters and for some reason Steve N' Seaguls.  </p>
                    <p class="wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn">My daughter's name is Hannah, she's 4 and she's the light that lightens my life, most of the time. Kids are difficult did you know? Well nobody told me. I'm joking, she's the reason why my heart's still beating and the reason why you should hire me for your project, otherwise she won't have any food on her plate.</p>
